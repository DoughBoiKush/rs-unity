     * The main RealityServer Client Library class that can process
     * RealityServer commands. This interface specifies the methods and 
     * properties that allows commands to be processed by RealityServer 
     * and introduce a couple of important concepts that will be briefly 
     * covered here.
     * 
     * <b>%Command Processing</b>
     * The most obvious goal of the RealityServer client library is to 
     * make it as easy as possible to process RealityServer webservice 
     * commands. The service accepts commands for processing from the 
     * application, for instance by calling RSService.AddCommand(). 
     * Commands will be processed one by one in the order they are added. 
     * If the responses of the commands are of interest it is possible to 
     * add response handlers that will be called when commands have been
     * processed. The service can optimize command processing by sending 
     * a bunch of commands to the server at once, but logically all 
     * commands are serialized and processed one by one. Commands also 
     * fail individually so command processing will always continue with 
     * the next command even if the previous command failed. %Command 
     * processing
     * is asynchronous and adding commands while the service is busy will 
     * cause the commands to queue up, meaning it might take some time 
     * before they are finally sent to the server and processed. The 
     * RealityServer client library will alwasy process all added commands
     * and even if processing of commands might be delayed there is no 
     * concept of a command queue or any possibility to remove reduntant
     * commands once they are added to the service. This means that it is 
     * vital that the application don't add any redundant commands. To be 
     * able to accomplish this the application will need some way to know 
     * when the service is ready to process commands. This is solved by 
     * the central concept called <i>Process Commands Callback</i>.
     * 
     * <b>Process Commands Callback</b>
     * 
     * This is the core mechanism that the RealityServer Client 
     * Library use to process commands and is used to 
     * know when the service is ready to process commands. When the 
     * application needs to process commands, for instance in response
     * to user input, it should generally not add the commands directly
     * by using RSService.AddCommand(). Instead it should add a Process 
     * Commands Callback by calling RSService.AddCallback(callbackFunc). 
     * What the application essentially say is this: Hello service! I
     * have some commands I need to process. Please call the supplied 
     * function when you have time to process them. The service may 
     * then call this function immediately, or after some time if 
     * currently busy, at which point the application adds the commands.
     * 
     * <p>When adding a callback using RSService.AddCallback() it will be 
     * placed in a callback queue. Each callback represents some part of 
     * the application that wish to process commands, for instance to 
     * update the scene database, render the scene, or maybe persist some 
     * data to a database. Each callback, when made, can then add zero or 
     * more commands that will then be processed by the service immediately.
     * It is important to note that while there is no concept of a command 
     * queue in the RealityServer Client Library, there is a process
     * commands callback queue instead. The same callback can only be 
     * added once at a time, but is single shot. When the applicaiton needs 
     * to process commands again it needs add the callback again. It is the 
     * responsibility of the application to keep track of user input, etc,
     * occuring in the time between adding the callback and when it is 
     * actually made, at which point the application must add an optimized
     * sequence of commands.</P>
     * 
     * <b><i>Exmple:</i></b> Scene Navigation
     * 
     * <p>An application wants to implement scene navigation by letting the
     * user drag the mouse on the rendered scnene image. To accomplish this 
     * the application would have to perform the following steps: </p>
     * <p><b>1.</b> When the user triggers a mouse drag event, register a 
    * process commands callback and indicate that a callback is pending.</p>
        * 
        * <p><b>2.</b> While the callback is pending, update a client local 
        * camera transform each time the user triggers new mouse drag events.</p>
        * 
        * <p><b>3.</b> When the callback is made, add a RealityServer command
        * that updates the camera transform to the current value.
        * </p>
        * 
        * <p><b>4.</b> Clear the indication that a callback is pending and 
        * repeat from step 1.</p>
        *
        * <p>As can be seen in this example the callback mechanism can be used 
        * to add a single command to update the camera transform at the time when
        * the service is ready to process the command. This can't be accomplished 
        * with the RSService.AddCommand() method since the service will always 
        * execute all commands added and there is no way to know when it is a good 
        * time to add commands. It is important to note that RSService.AddCommand() 
        * is just a convenience method so that a callback does not need to be 
        * registered when not needed. Internally a call to AddCommand will result 
        * in a callback being added to the callback queue, so commands added this 
        * way will not be executed before any callbacks already in the queue.  
        * This means that adding command A using AddCommand() is equivalent to 
        * adding a callback and adding A when the callback is made. An example 
        * when callbacks are not needed is for instance when initializing an 
        * application. During initialization it is common for a fixed sequence 
        * of commands, for instance to load a scene, create scopes, etc, to be 
        * executed. It is perfectly safe to use both AddCommand() and the 
        * callback mechanism at the same time.</p>
        * 
        * <p><b>State Data</b></p>
        * 
        * <p>RealityServer commands are executed in a specific state that is set 
        * up by optional state handers on the server. The state handler 
        * determines things like the scope in which to execute commands based on
        * parameters passed with the low level request, for 
        * instance an HTTP request. Since the user of the RealityServer Client 
        * library should not have to worry how commands are sent to the server
        * this state data is instead specified using an object implementing the 
        * StateData interface. This interface allow specification of a path 
        * and a set of key/value pairs that the server side state handler then
        * inspects to determine the state to execute the commands in. The 
        * StateData instance to use when executing a command is determined 
        * when calling the RSService.AddCallback method (or the 
                * RSService.AddCommand method). All commands added in the callback 
        * will be associated with this state data and the service will make sure
        * that the commands are processed on the server in such a way that the 
        * RealityServer state handler is invoked with the provided data. Note 
        * that this means that to add commands using different state data they 
        * have to be added in different callbacks. The StateData interface also
        * allow specification of state commands which can be used to for instance
        * call the set_scope command. Again the service will make sure that 
        * commands are processed on the server in such a way that state commands
        * affect all the commands associated with a specific StateData instance.
        * </p>
        * 
        * <p>RSService also allow setting a default StateData to use when no 
        * explicit state data is specified in calls to AddCommand or AddCallback.
        * If no state is specified at all then the commands will be executed in 
        * the default (global) scope.</p>
        * 
        * <p><b>Connectors</b></p>
        * 
        * <p>The RealityServer Client library delegates actual processing of 
        * commands to a connector. All client library implementations support
        * a HTTP connector which process commands using HTTP requests. The 
        * ActionScript libary also supports an RTMP connector in addition to 
        * the HTTP connector which can be enabled to get access to RTMP specific 
        * commands. The %RSService.connectorName can be used to determine which 
        * connector is currently in use. The RSService will also dispatch 
        * %RSService events to indication when the connector has switched so that 
        * the application can take advantage of any connector specific commands.
        * </p>
